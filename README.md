Project's Purpose or Goal: Provide users with daily COVID outbreak reports. Stretch goals include displaying an outbreak map, as well as including other criteria to avoid states.

* MVP 
Receive daily COVID cases by state from an outside source

Compare states total COVID cases per day to determine hotspots(criteria TBD)

For example, the criteria could be a threshold of daily cases determines a hotspot. TBD

* User Stories:

A user should be able to visit the homepage and see a list of states to avoid based on daily COVID case levels

* Tools used:
Ruby/Rails, Javascript. I believe I need more flexibility implementing this project, so I am going back to a programming language I am more comfortable with. I will be scraping daily COVID data from other sources(potentially an API if one exists). Lots of room for additional features with this project.

* Stretch

multiple states: avoid a state when it meets 3 criteria: bad covid rates, violence, bad weather, etc. avoid this state if meets criteria 


make account, add your states to track. daily email 

styling- added bootstrap, how do i use it now

home page with cdc mask guidelines, video from fauci etc

A map of the U.S. that shows outbreak rates by color

A state map of Oregon showing daily outbreak rates by county

* Additional Tools 

This project will require accurate daily COVID cases from an online source, such as the CDC or other reputable source. My additional goal of including a map will require additional tools if I have time to attempt this feature.

* Misc

This app is named States to Avoid. If I have additional time, I may include other reasons to avoid states, such as violence, crime, or other criteria. Thanks!
