# README

Project's Purpose or Goal: Provide users with daily COVID outbreak reports. Stretch goals include displaying an outbreak map, as well as including other criteria to avoid states.

* MVP  
Receive daily COVID cases by state from an outside source

Compare states total COVID cases per day to determine hotspots(criteria TBD)

For example, the criteria could be a threshold of daily cases determines a hotspot. TBD

* User Stories:

A user should be able to visit the homepage and see a list of states to avoid based on daily COVID case levels

* Tools used:

Attempted to implement this in React. Repo here: https://github.com/hagoodwi92/covid-19-tracker-react. 

Instead, I will implement this in Ruby/Rails as originally planned, and if I have time I will add rails-react for advanced styling. 


Ruby/Rails, Javascript. I believe I need more flexibility implementing this project, so I am going back to a programming language I am more comfortable with. I will be scraping daily COVID data from other sources(potentially an API if one exists). Lots of room for additional features with this project.

* Stretch

all 50 states in the bar graph, daily new deaths 

search funtion to find a state, with state map even!

A chart with data

A map of the U.S. that shows outbreak rates by color

multiple states: avoid a state when it meets 3 criteria: bad covid rates, violence, bad weather, etc. avoid this state if meets criteria 

make account, add your states to track. daily email 

home page with cdc mask guidelines, video from fauci etc

A state map of Oregon showing daily outbreak rates by county

* Additional Tools 

This project will require accurate daily COVID cases from an online source, such as the CDC or other reputable source. My additional goal of including a map will require additional tools if I have time to attempt this feature.

* Misc

This app is named States to Avoid. If I have additional time, I may include other reasons to avoid states, such as violence, crime, or other criteria. Thanks!
